# Neural_network
One of the many tests i did during my finals to gain experience in machine learning and image processing

This code represents a basic neural network made for clasiffying images. Using the keras dataset <b>fashion_mnist</b> i've created a simple basic neural network to try and classify the images from the dataset.
